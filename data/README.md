The iris dataset was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
Specifically, the link to the data is: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
The following documentation was also downloaded, 
then placed in the directory this file is in: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.names

The following data directories exist for the project:

- raw: contains the original file as donwloaded. The program get_raw_from_uciml.py in the scripts directory was used to download it.

- processed: contains a csv file version of the data with headers. The 0_initial_data_management.ipynb was used to create this dataset.

Note: I am version controlling all the data since it is rather small in size. Normally, I would not version control data.
